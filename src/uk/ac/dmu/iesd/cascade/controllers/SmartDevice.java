/**
 * A <em>SmartDevice</em> is an object for energy management/control installed (integrated)
 * in (within) some/most of the prosumers (e.g. HouseholdProsumers). 
 * They belong (or will be controlled after trading contract) by aggregator agents (*CO: such as RECO or ESCO)
 * by adding (registering) themselves as observer (of the state / signal) of an aggregator agent.
 * In other words, they will be updated (receiving signals) by the aggregator agent (at its discretion) in which
 * they are dealing with (have contract with).
