/**
 * A <em>ESCO</em> or an Electricity Service Company is a concrete object that represents 
 * a commercial/business electricity/energy company involved in retail trade with
 * prosumer agents (<code>ProsumerAgent</code>), such as household prosumers (<code>HouseholdProsumer</code>)
 * In other words, an <code>ESCO</code> provides electricity/energy services to certain types of prosumers (e.g. households)
 * Unlike typical retail companies, (<code>RECO</code>s) will not provide simply electricity, but the
 * service which may include the intelligent management of energy need. <p>
 * It may be also involved in the electricity market.
